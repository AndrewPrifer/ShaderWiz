# ShaderWiz for Unity is now open source!
ShaderWiz is now free and open source under the very permissive MIT license. You can still buy me a coffee for streamlined package updates from the [Asset Store][]. I do accept pull requests.

## ShaderWiz 1.0
ShaderWiz is an editor extension for the [Unity game engine][] that lets you focus on the most important part of shader creation: the shader itself! It eliminates the hassle of configuring your shader in code, by providing an easy to use interface. ShaderWiz generates all the necessary property fields, input struct members, preprocessor directives, custom functions, so that you just need to fill in the blanks without having to read countless pages of the Unity manual.

## Features
- Support for vertex shaders
- Support for fragment shaders
- Support for geometry shader
- Support for surface shaders
- Gives you maximum control over the generated code
- Easy to use interface with helpful tooltips
- Generates beautiful code with helpful comments
- And many more!

## Save time!
Dive into Unity shader creation right away! No need to browse through any documentation or to learn ShaderLab - just write the shader, and ShaderWiz handles the rest.

## Write less code!
Let ShaderWiz do the heavy lifting for you by generating the skeleton and configuration for your shader! Your shader will already have the necessary setup, so you just have to fill in the blanks.

## Make better shaders!
By using ShaderLab, you ensure that you don't miss any little detail in your setup, everything is presented to you by a clear and concise interface that shows you just the right amount of information.

## Still need to do:
- Support for tessellation shaders
- Support for the new Unity 5 ShaderLab options
